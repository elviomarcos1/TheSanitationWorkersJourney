🎮 Project "The Sanitation Worker's Journey"
👋 Welcome!

We are pleased to present the project "Gari's Journey", developed as part of the Supervised Practical Activity course, taught by Professor Gustavo during the first semester of 2024.

🧩 Challenge
The proposed challenge for this project was of great significance: to develop a game with the theme of combating pollution.
🌱 A mission that required effort and dedication, but proved to be enriching in its complexity.

🕹️ The Game
Aiming to meet the standards of excellence required, we used the Java programming language ☕, as recommended by Professor Gustavo.

This choice allowed us to fully explore the potential of the LibGDX library 🔧 for implementing the game’s physics and mechanics.

Additionally:
🗺️ Tiled was used for detailed map design, providing an immersive visual experience.
🎨 Some textures were created using Piskel, giving the project a polished aesthetic.

We’re excited to share this journey with you! 🚀
We believe that "Gari's Journey" offers not only a fun experience 🎉, but also an educational 🌍 and thought-provoking one.
